### Prepare to get excited

The first screenshots are coming out, and if I can be forgiven for saying this myself, it looks pretty excellent! Get your chops around this bad boy!

So you can see a fully functional dungeon there with a whole load of different room types. The heroes are running through it and using the facilities and reviews are coming in with star ratings. It's all going on!

### What's left - this looks shippable!

Well the game isn't quite fun enough, I need to tweak the settings for gold to make sure that it is actually challenging to balance the books, and the battle system for rooms that allow battles is pretty much non-existant. But it will be there soon!
