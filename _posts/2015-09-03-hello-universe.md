So I thought it would be a great idea to have a go at this years JS13k challenge - where you produce a game that is less than 13kb in size - and this is my entry.

### Yeah, but what is it?

Well it's called `Dungeon Advisor` and the roles of the standard dungeon roguelike have been reversed, meaning you are resonsible for delivering a compelling dungeon rogue experience. 

### How?

You have a few tools at your disposal, you can create rooms in your dungeon that cater to certain needs. You can stick enemies in certain rooms that your heroes can take on, and provide services like inn's, hospitals and all sorts for your guests to enjoy (and hopefully blow some cash on). At the end of a heroes journey they will give you a Trip Advisor style review, where stars mean points and points means respect.

### Ok so bad-ass 3D Dungeon-Keeper inspired graphics right?

Not quite - this has to squeeze into a 13kb zip file, so instead of high quality 3d models or sprites I decided to go with... *ASCII*

### Oh-noes

Oh-yesses more like, look at this highly detailed magic

### When can I play it?

I hope to have a pre-release up here soon, so that I can get some bug fixers in, prior to submission on the 13th September. Keep an eye out chums :seedling:
