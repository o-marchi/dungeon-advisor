**Dungeon Advisor** is my entry to the 2015 [JS13k](http://js13kgames.com/) game jam - where you have to make a Javascript game in less than 13kb!

### [Play the game!](http://royletron.github.io/dungeon-advisor/tests/)
*Plays best on Firefox on Windows, or Chrome on OSX - You will get missing characters on other browsers*.. **13kb People!!**

## Instructions

*Hopefully you can figure it out when you play it... Minecraft doesn't have instructions!** But the basic premise is you are in charge of a dungeon that is going to be visited by all of the heroes of the land. The heroes are an odd bunch and they like fighting, drinking and shopping (as well as some other less wholesome things) so you need to make sure your dungeon appeals. As you go new types of heroes will start visiting and new rooms will become available. Be sure to keep the money coming in whilst getting 5 star reviews!

## Issues

**Should you find a bug** - please report it, you can use the [issues](https://github.com/royletron/dungeon-advisor/issues) here on Github. Screenshots are very helpful and if it completely crashes a JS console log is vital!
